This lab workbook contains hands-on material supplementing the OpenRefine workshops taught by [John Little](https://johnlittle.info/) and hosted by the [Data & Visualization Services Department](https://library.duke.edu/data/), Duke University Libraries. 

Recent modification of this workbook were written to augment a series of [slide deck presentations](https://johnlittle.info/dsvil2018/) developed for the [Data Science Visualization Institute for Librarians](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/data-science-and-visualization-institute).  The slides and workbook, together and along with the face-to-face presentations, intend to encourage data-savvy skills-development.  Use these resources to guide your learning through a series of data experiments that illustrate different aspects of data manipulation.  If you'd like, watch [a video recorded from an earlier workshop](preamble.html#workshop-video).

Additionally, short-clip, silent videos are integrated into the workbook chapters.  The soundless quality of these instructional videos are intended to enhance student learning by offering addition instructional options during group training sessions.  The videos also serve to illustrate concepts and techniques presented in the workbook, which otherwise has minimal explanatory text.
